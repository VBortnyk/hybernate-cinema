1. Open the project in your IDE.

2. Add Java SDK 11 or above in Project Structure.

3. Configure Tomcat:
add the artifact cinema-project:war exploded;
add as URL http://localhost:8080/

4. Install MySQL if you don't have it and start MySQLWorkbench.

5. At src.main.resources.db.properties use your username 
and password for your MySQLWorkbench to create a Connection.

6. Run this line to create a schema: CREATE SCHEMA `cinema` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8.

7. Change a path to log file in src.main.resources.log4j.properties.

8. Run the project.

9. For testing this API you can download Postman or another such an analogue.

10. For authorization, you must add a new header, where Authorization is key and Basic email:password is value, where email:password must be encoded to Base64 format.

There is test data that you can use.
There’s one user already registered with ADMIN role (email = "admin@gmail.com"", password = "admin") and
one user with USER role (email = "user@gmail.com"", password = "user""). You can change these test data in InjectDataController if you want.
